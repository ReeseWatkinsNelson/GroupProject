**OBJECTIVE** :          This Group Project Repo is where the group will conduct an in-depth exploration
                         on Salary Data in Data-Related Roles using the Data Analysis Process to answer 
                         specific high-level questions. 
            
_Ask and Identify_     - Answering and coming up with high level questions helps frame our variables against
                         the backdrop of available data. In this case, the project will involve 
                         the main variable **_Paid Wage Per Year_**, and several other variables found in the 
                         salary dataset such as but not limited to: **_State/Region, Job Sub-type, Experience, 
                         and Education_**. 

_Prepare and Process_  - Preparation involves integrating Salary data into a working environment with group members.
                         This uniform accessibility to a main dataset version reinforces consistency throughout the project
                         Processing preserves data integrity while narrowing the scope of the data being worked with. 
                         This can involve cleaning, manipulation, and transformation of variables that are deemed irrelevant
                         or relevant in respect to the objective. Ultimately, this sets up the stage for an effective analysis.
                                        
_Analyze_              - In the Analysis step, insights and patterns are to be uncovered from explorative research. Findings
                         should observe the relationship between the Key Performance Indicator, Paid Wage, and other job variables. 
                         Tools such as R, Python, or SQL yield will help yield a layer of complexity to the data's interpretation. 
                         Ultimately, this provides answers to the questions we are seeking to answer from a exploratory analysis.

_Share_                - Sharing an analysis on data-related jobs requires visualizing the data into an interpretable 
                         manner for presentation. Charts, Graphs, and tables will support logic taken to answer 
                         questions regarding our objective.

There are a total of Seven (7) questions that will be answered and supported by data. 

Question #1 (Vinh)   - Do specific sub-types of data-related jobs have higher or lower salaries than others?

Question #2 (Reese)  - What states have the highest paying data-related salaries ?

Question #3 (Swikar) - How do offered salaries compare to the prevailing wage ?

Question #4 (Reese)  - How do salaries differ per geographic region ? Are there specific data-related roles
                       found in these regions ?

Question #5 (Vinh)   - What specific sub-types require higher experience and education, is this correlated
                       with salary ?

Question #6 (Kshitij)  - What salaries are "normal" when looking at a distribution of salaries. Is there any 
                       trends or patterns found within this salary distribution.

Question #7 (Kshitij) - How does company size or industry influence salary levels for data-related roles?
