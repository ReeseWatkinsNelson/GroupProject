**OBJECTIVE** : This Group Project Repo is where our group will be conducting an in-depth exploration
                on Salary Data using the Data Analysis Process. 
            
_Ask and Identify_ - Answering and coming up with high level questions about the data helps 
      frame the desired variables we are focusing on. In this case, the project will involve 
      the main variable **_Paid Wage Per Year_**, and several other variables found in the 
      salary dataset such as but not limited to: **_State/Region, Job Sub-type, Experience, 
      and Education_**. 

_Prepare and Process_ - Going through this process requires data cleaning, manipulation, and 
      transformation. This will better frame the target data to yield a quality analysis. Data 
      processing tools such as **_Python, R, and SQL_** are the means to this step of our Analysis.
